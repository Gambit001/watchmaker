| Finding Comment/Name                              | Validity    | Explanation                                       |
|:--------------------------------------------------|-------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| Disable GSSAPI Authentication | Conditional | Setting is typically remediated, but can subsequently be overridden by installation/activation of a centralized authentication tool (e.g. Power Broker Identity Services) |
| Use Only FIPS 140-2 Validated Ciphers | Spurious | Formula-implemented cipher-string is actually *more* strict: STIGs specify `aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,aes128-cbc,3des-cbc,aes192-cbc,aes256-cbc`; watchmaker implements `aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr` |
| Use Only FIPS 140-2 Validated MACs | Spurious | Formula-implemented MAC-string is actually *more* strict: STIGs specify `hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha1`; watchmaker implements `hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256` |
| Modify the System Login Banner | Spurious | Banner text is valid for site but scanner regex does not properly detect that it's correct |
| Ensure PAM Displays Last Logon/Access Notification | Conditional | Setting is typically remediated, but can subsequently be overridden by installation/activation of a centralized authentication tool (e.g. Power Broker Identity Services) |
| Enable Smart Card Login | Conditional | Smart Card Login use and configuration is site-specific, effectively rendering it out of scope for watchmaker |
| Configure the Firewalld Ports | Spurious | Scanner regex appears to be searching for `service: ssh` but there are other tokens in the `services:` list returned by firewalld |
| Set Default firewalld Zone for Incoming Packets | Valid | Watchmaker currently leave default zone as `public`; scanner expects `Drop`|
| Disable Kernel Parameter for IP Forwarding | Spurious | The prescribed `net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0` is set by watchmaker in `/etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf` and executing `sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward` on watchmaker-hardened system returns `net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0` |
| The Installed Operating System Is Vendor Supported | Conditional | Not watchmaker-addressable: should always fail on CentOS |
| Install McAfee Virus Scanning Software | Conditional | Watchmaker will install HBSS or VSEL where configured to do so; any scan-findings on systems watchmaker has been configured to install HBSS or VSEL are typically due to version mismatches between installed and scanned-for versions |
| Enable FIPS Mode in GRUB2 | Spurious | Scanner flagging due to token-ordering issue: both spel and watchmaker implement `fips=1` by default, but token-location does not match scanned-for location |
| Configure AIDE to Use FIPS 140-2 for Validating Hashes | Valid | Watchmker currently sets mode to `sha256+acl+xattrs`; STIGs prescribe `FIPSR+sha512` |
| Verify and Correct Ownership with RPM	| Spurious | Flags on system-journal ownership, which is automatically reset by systemd (upon reboot) after hardening has run: no means of permanently remediating is currently possible. Similarly, if HBSS or VSEL is installed, scan may flag on user-ownership depending on how site specifies installation of HBSS or VSEL (reasonably expect similar for other, third-party packages) - "fixing" (per STIG guidance) would likely break the functioning of the third-party software.  |
| Verify and Correct File Permissions with RPM | Spurious | Flags on system-journal ownership, which is automatically reset by systemd (upon reboot) after hardening has run: no means of permanently remediating is currently possible. Also flags on delivered CA-trust files which are dynamicly-set (no means of permanently remediating is currently possible). Lastly, flags on third-party tools' files (like splunk).|
| Ensure Users Re-Authenticate for Privilege Escalation - sudo NOPASSWD	| Conditional | Flagged-configuration is required for properly enabling a "break-glass" account at provisioning-time. |
