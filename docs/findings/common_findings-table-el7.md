| Finding Summary | Finding Identifier | Validity | Explanation |
|:--------------------------------------------------|:----------|:-------------:|:--------------------------------------------------|
| Use Only FIPS 140-2 Validated Ciphers | SV-86845<br/>RHEL-07-040110 | Invalid | Watchmaker implements setting valid through EL7 STIGv2R6 (released: October 2019) |
| Use Only FIPS 140-2 Validated MACs | SV-86877<br/>RHEL-07-040400 | Invalid | Watchmaker implements setting valid through EL7 STIGv2R6 (released: October 2019) |
| Modify the System Login Banner | SV-86487<br/>RHEL-07-010050 | Invalid | Watchmaker implements site-prescribed banner. Scan-profile's regex may not be flexible enough to match the site-prescribed banner as implemented by watchmaker |
| Enable Smart Card Login | SV-86589<br/>RHEL-07-010500 | Conditional | Smart Card Login use and configuration is site-specific. Site has not provided specification for implementing this setting in scanned context |
| Configure the Firewalld Ports | SV-86843<br/>RHEL-07-040100 | Invalid | Watchmaker implements setting but scanner regex may not be sufficiently-flexible in its specification. |
| Set Default firewalld Zone for Incoming Packets | SV-86939<br/>RHEL-07-040810 | Valid | [Issue](https://github.com/plus3it/ash-linux-formula/issues/285) submitted to relevant sub-project for fix |
| Disable Kernel Parameter for IP Forwarding | SV-86933<br/>RHEL-07-040740 | Invalid | The prescribed `net.ipv4.ip_forward` value is set by watchmaker in `/etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf`. Executing `sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward` on watchmaker-hardened system returns expected `net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0` result |
| The Installed Operating System Is Vendor Supported | SV-86621<br/>RHEL-07-020250 | Invalid | No programmatic validation or remediation prescribed or universally-implementable: requires manual validation with OS-vendor lifecycle information page(s). |
| Install McAfee Virus Scanning Software | SV-86837<br/>RHEL-07-032000 | Conditional | Watchmaker will install HBSS or VSEL _where configured to do so_: any scan-findings on systems watchmaker has been configured to install HBSS or VSEL are typically due to version mismatches between installed and scanned-for versions; where required/scanned for but not installed, site will need to specify automatable installation-method that will produce match againste scanned-for configuration; where not required, scan-results should be ignored . |
| Enable FIPS Mode in GRUB2 | SV-86691<br/>RHEL-07-021350 | Conditional | Both spel and watchmaker implement `fips=1` by default. If finding occurs, there is an error in scanner's validation-method or system has been intentionally de-configured for FIPS. |
| Configure AIDE to Use FIPS 140-2 for Validating Hashes | SV-86697<br/>RHEL-07-021620 | Valid | [Issue](https://github.com/plus3it/ash-linux-formula/issues/284) submitted to relevant sub-project for fix |
| Verify and Correct Ownership with RPM | SV-86473<br/>RHEL-07-010010 | Invalid | Flags on system-journal ownership, which is automatically reset by systemd (upon reboot) after hardening has run: no means of permanently remediating is currently possible. Similarly, if HBSS or VSEL is installed, scan may flag on user-ownership depending on how site specifies installation of HBSS or VSEL (reasonably expect similar for other, third-party packages) - "fixing" (per STIG guidance) would likely break the functioning of the third-party software. |
| Verify and Correct File Permissions with RPM | SV-86473<br/>RHEL-07-010010 | Invalid | Flags on system-journal ownership, which is automatically reset by systemd (upon reboot) after hardening has run: no means of permanently remediating is currently possible. Also flags on delivered CA-trust files which are dynamicly-set (no means of permanently remediating is currently possible). Lastly, flags on third-party tools' files (like Splunk) |
| Ensure Users Re-Authenticate for Privilege Escalation - sudo NOPASSWD | SV-86571<br/>RHEL-07-010340 | Conditional | Flagged-configuration is required for properly enabling a "break-glass" account at provisioning-time (particularly in consoleless environments like AWS) |
